Cutting Fields From A CSV File December 7, 2021

Over at Stack Overflow, I answered a question about cutting fields from a CSV
file. Paraphrasing:

    A file in CSV format has a header row containing field names followed by
record rows containing actual data. The user wants to cut fields from the CSV
file to create a new CSV file containing only the specified fields, specifying
the fields by name instead of using their ordinal position.

Your task is to write a program to cut fields from a CSV file by name. When you
are finished, you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post
your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.
